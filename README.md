# Experiment6

Executable file: /Builds/Experiment6.exe

A 6-player local multiplayer party game.

Each player has only one button that controls when their stickman jumps. The goal of each round is to stay alive as long as possible while numerous lethal spikes and projectiles hurtle around the arena. Use your jumps to avoid these obstacles and use powerups to aid your survival or harm the survival of others. At the end of each round, points will be allocated to each player depending on their order of deaths and rounds will continue until a player has more than 30 points and has a 2-point lead over second place.

Controls and powerup descriptions in-game.
